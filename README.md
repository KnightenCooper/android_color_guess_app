# Overview

With this coding project I wanted to learn about Android software development and dip my toe into the waters. As a software engineering student, I want to gain exposure to a variety
of different technologies to see how they are the same and different from each other. This project was an excellent way to see what it takes to create Android apps and how they work.

The app I created is a simple quiz game and tests the user about 10 different colors. The app gets the user's name and then asks the user to select the word that matches the
color. If the user guesses right, then the box turns green, if the user guesses wrong then the box they clicked turns red and the correct box turns green. The final screen
of the app shows the user's name and how many questions they got right out of ten.

My purpose in creating this app was to get practice creating a Android app and utilizing Android Studio. I wanted to learn how to switch between screens, get user inputs, use
the inputs to change what the app displayed and see how Android apps work. I enjoyed making this app and look forward to what else I can accomplish with Android apps in the 
future.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I used Android Studio to develop this app. I took full advantage of Android Studio's builtin emulator to test my code. Android Studio was the perfect choice for this project 
because it is the official integrated development environment for Google's Android operating system.

My app uses the programming language Kotlin.

# Future Work

* I would love to add different quizzes that the user can choose from instead of just colors.
* I would like to add the option of creating custom quizzes the user can add to the app.
* I would love to make it so that user's can sign in and share their study quizzes with other students.
